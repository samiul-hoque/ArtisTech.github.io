Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. After years of lazying around with wordpress, I think it's about time to get this done.
Neat thing about it is that its powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
Credit goes to [Jonathan Mcglone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages) for his noob friendly guide.
