# High Altitude Balloon Project for BlackHorse

This High Altitude Balloon project was done for a commercial for a local Energy Drink brand. Due to various regulatory restrictions on High Altitude balooning in Bangladesh along with restrictions on hobbyist RF spectrums, most of the technical details of the project could not be made public for security reasons.

The goal of the advertisement campaign was to take the Bangladeshi Flag as high as possible. It was a big project with many names involved where I was in fabrication. I made the high gain Yagi antenna, payload, onboard circuitry used in the project.

There were multiple attempts and finally the third attempt yielded results after we hacked the GoPro Session. Battery characteristics in extreme temperatures caused the major problems in the first two launches. Finally though, We were able to achieve a height of 1 lac 6 thousand feet.(32.4km) 
Here are some screenshots collected from the actual footage.

The Payload was 500gm with the following content
+ Raspberry Pi 2
+ Communication module with antenna
+ Go Pro Hero Session
+ Primary GPS: Ublox Neo 6M
+ secondary GPS: Spot Tracker
+ Temperature sensors: DS18b20
+ Pressure sensor: BMP185
+ Batteries: Energizer ultimate Lithium
+ Enclosure: Hand carved Styrofoam

We used Helium gas supplied by Linde. Fun fact, pure helium is a very expensive resource in Bangladesh. Most of our resources were exhausted just to pay for the gas. Keeping the payload weight under 500gm was quite a challenge. 
I don't have access to the press release presentation I made for the campaign along with the raw footage. All relevant documentation I have can be found in the following [project repository](https://github.com/samiul-hoque/HAB-BlackHorse).

Technical Parameters of the third launch:
+ Total Flight Time : 3 Hours 26 Minutes 41 seconds.
+ Total ascend Time: 2 Hours 07 minutes 12 seconds.
+ Total decent Time : 1 hours 19 minutes 29 seconds.
+ Lateral Displacement : 68.8km
+ Lowest recorded outside Temperature: - 25.312 Degree Centigrade
+ Highest recorded Altitude : 32450.1 meters
