# High Performance GPU Cluster at the Center for Cognitive Skill Enhancement

I started working at CCSE as a researcher after a workshop on [High performance Computing with CUDA](http://ccse.iub.edu.bd/2016/06/06/training-on-parallel-computing-with-cuda/). I was immidiately assigned to it's maintenance at IUB after I helped out the instructor during the workshop with some 'technical difficulties'. My job at CCSE was to maintain day to day operations, trying out different Operating systems and optimization of resources.

The Operating system on the GPU cluster seemed very unstable because of finicky GPU drivers. It was quite a headache to keep it from crashing on a daily basis, which I later found out was because of a faulty display card.

The specs on the GPU cluster were,
+ Supermicro 747-20 (SuperChassis 747TQ-R1400B) chasis
+ dual Intel Xeon Processors 
+ 256 GB ECC RAM
+ 3TB SSD raid
+ 4x Nvidia K80 Graphics cards
+ A faulty cheap Nvidia display card :|
