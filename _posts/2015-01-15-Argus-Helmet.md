The Argus Helmet is a full motion tracking helmet for cyclists. It has an 11dof MPU, two ultrasonic sensors and two vibration sensors built in to provide tatctile feedback when vehicles approach the blindspots of a cyclist. The device is fully modular which can be attached to most bicycle helmets.

The project was developped during a hack-a-thon styled [workshop](https://www.facebook.com/events/754020381343024/?active_tab=about) hosted by [Nazmus Saquib](https://nsaquib.com).The event was an intensive crash course on rapid prototyping, design thinking and on multidisciplinary collaboration. 
Each team was comprised of people from different backgrounds and we came up with solutions for various real life problems.

Our team was comprised of Mainul Hasan Alin, Ishtiak Imam and myself. We came up with the Argus helmet because all of us were cyclists and road safety for cyclist's is a major problem which we deal with everyday.

We were also featured later at Digital World 2015 hosted by the ICT division. We later integrated the project into a game for a commercial project.
