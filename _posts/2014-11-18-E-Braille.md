 [E-Braille](https://www.facebook.com/pg/E-Braille-426982594125213/about/?ref=page_internal "E-Braille's Facebook Page")  was designed for the visually impaired to get tactile feedback from digital screens such an Android phone.

 The device consists of an arduino, 6 vibration motors, a bluetooth module and battery management circuitry. The Idea was to get character data on a digital surface when touched and send it to the glove to translate it into appropriate braille signature via tactile feedback.

 The device was designed during [Make-a-Thon](https://www.facebook.com/events/953731297989210/ "Event Link"), Bangladesh's first maker themed event and won first place. We also showcased the project at the Maker-fest hosted at Ahmedabad later that year.

 Our team comprised of Jonayet Hossain, Shaifur Rahman and Myself.
