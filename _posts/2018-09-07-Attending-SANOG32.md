I, for some reason, had a distaste for networking. Even back in university, networking courses gave me quite the trouble and I was beginning to believe I was naturally bad at it. In some weird twist of fate, I ended up working with a internet startup that deals with Software Defined Networks at the grassroots level.

To get to know the people who run the internet industry in bangladesh, [BDNOG](http://www.bdnog.org/) is the place to be. This year, BDNOG happened to be aligned with [SANOG32](http://www.sanog.org/sanog32/) which was a clear bonus for me. I met most of the biggest ISP folks in dhaka, got a crash course on how many levels does the internet game run in bangladesh.

The 5 workshop I took was under Dr. Phillip Smith on IPV6 deployment. The room was full of core engineers from all the major ISPs and there I was sitting there, for the first time seeing the ciscoIOS terminal. I struggled alot with the first 2 days but then gradually caught up. My team even ended up being the best performing team in the IPv6 session. Workshop resources can be found [here](http://www.bgp4all.com/dokuwiki/training/sanog32/start).

On the 3 day tutorials, I chose to split my days up and visit all three sessions on IoT(pyCom), server security(FreeBSD) and DNS security. I realized networking with people was more important than attending the lectures themselves as all resources are public anyway and I could learn them anyday. 
I ended up exchanging visiting cards with someone from almost all the big ISPs. Also found IoT/electronics enthusiasts who are working at BDCOM. It was certainly a very productive workshop
