# Woodworking Projects

Wood to me is probably the most intriguing material to work with. The way it is processed from a tree trunk to a polished piece amazes me everyday. It feels like the materials is almost alive as how it comes to life with it's full beauty after a coating of oil.

I have been working at a Wood factory for a while now, to learn and adapt to the surrounding industry. Can not thank [Dovetail](https://www.instagram.com/dovetailbd/) enough for letting me hang around and use their tools.
