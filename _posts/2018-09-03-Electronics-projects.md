# Electronics Projects

I have been working with electronics since 2012. It all started when I was a student at BRAC University and I decided to go to an Arduino Workshop at Pixelizard Labs. I was having trouble with basic programming courses as I found it hard to relate what I was being taught and how they would come to use. One Arduino blink code changed all that and my whole career kind of spiralled into what it is today.
I have been involved in various industrial/commercial projects from time to time, mostly as an electronics consultant. I am experienced in PCB design in Altium, EagleCAD and proteus, depending on which company I was working for.
Along with that, I have taken various workshops specifically focused on electronics. Right now I am focusing on writing web content in my free time. I have worked with almost all the boards, sensors and peripheral electronics components available in the local market. 

Here are random photos of some of my electronics projects;
