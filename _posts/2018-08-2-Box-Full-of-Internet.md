# Internet Box

The internet box project is one of my ongoing works. My partners, Malinda Senanayeke and Mainul Hasan Alin approached me with the idea in the beginning of June, 2018. We did ideation to prototyping and then pilot deployment in just 4 months.This was possible only because of the multidisciplinary nature of our team, I can not thank them enough. None of us knew anything about the internet industry in Bangladesh and yet we dived into it and came far enough to pull it off.

Our idea was to provide High Speed Internet facilities to marginally low income areas such as Korail Slums. We had to deal with local thugs, unavailability of internet, poor infrastrcture and technological difficulties that come with deployment of such projects.

The first prototype was developped and deployed in a month or so after we built our backend based on OpenWRT and coovachilli. We deployed it in a coffee shop near my house for testing purposes. I was worried if the cheap TP-link router inside could handle enough users. Lucky for us the router resources consumed peaked at about 60%. This was a green signal to deploy at the heart of Korail, a slum right in the middle of Dhaka.

For the Korail deployment, we used better materials for the box and better hardware inside. So far the version 2 boxes are still running at full capacity.

After our initial success at the first shop, we set up 4 more nodes and replaced our version 2 boxes with version 3 ones. These boxes were brightly colored to attract attention and blended nicely with the surroundings.

We also ended up attending BDNog and SANOG32 in order to get to know the people running the internet industry. To run an internet startup, networking with ISP people was necessary.
