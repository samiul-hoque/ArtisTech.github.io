# Internet Box

The Internet box is one of my ongoing projects. The aim of the project is to provide internet to the dense slum areas of Bangladesh. I’ve been working on the project since mid 2018 with my partners Mainul Hasan Alin and Malinda Senanayeke.

Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries while it’s capital, Dhaka is the third most populous city in the world with a population density of 59,595 per sq. mile. The sheer number of people make it very difficult for its resident to get access to proper high speed internet. 
Mobile internet is the primary access to the web for most of the people here, while they remain quite expensive compared to the GDP here. Even after paying a lot for data packs, the abysmal internet speeds due to the density of mobile devices makes it quite impossible to work with.
Life here moves around the tea stalls. In most slum areas, the tea stores are public gathering spots where they watch TV, interact and talk over a sip of tea. Tea stalls are always densely packed, with foot traffic reaching over 1,000 easily on an average sized tea store.

Our goal is to provide internet using Wi-Fi Hotspots to local communities at tea stores while making the setup sustainable to the tea stall owners.

Business Model:
Our business model operates on 2 entities and it was developed throughout the pilot project. We are currently running this setup for data collection to collect some funding.

+ A vendor asks us to set up a hotspot at their shop. The vendor, in our case is the tea stall owner
+ We set up the internet connection from any local third party ISP using the vendor’s ID and give him a router.
+ The vendor gets free Wi-Fi for his devices (up to 2 devices), in which most cases are a TV and his personal phone.
+ The router broadcasts a public Wife Hotspot.
+ Maintenance on the router is done by us, in case of technical difficulties while the ISP and the vendor maintain the internet connection and power issues.
+ The vendor will pay the internet and power by selling coupons. We take a 40% cut on each coupon.


+ A customer will come in to the shop and buy tokens from the vendor.
+ The customer can connect to the open hotspot and enter his 4 digit coupon to get access to unlimited high speed internet for 3 hours at any of our hotspots.
