# Raspberry Pi Hadoop Cluster

To tinker around with distributed computation and my love of electronics, I built a hadoop cluster of 4 nodes. This project was done with resources allocated from the CCSE lab.

As I am quite the noob my work was completely based on [Jonas Widriksson](http://www.widriksson.com/)'s tutorial on setting up a Raspberry Pi 2 Hadoop Cluster.

Here's a [link](http://www.widriksson.com/raspberry-pi-2-hadoop-2-cluster/) to the official tutorial for details.
