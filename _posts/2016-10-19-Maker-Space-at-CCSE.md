# Setting up Makerspace at CCSE 

Of the many things that I did at CCSE, I am most proud of the makerspace I built there. Like all Institutional labs in bangladesh, it had near infinite resources and not a single motivated person to come forward and take initiative to build things. University research at Bangladeshi Universities is stagnant and stuck in the same loop of papers, research andprojects that never see the real world. The man in charge of CCSE while I was working there was Dr. Ali Shihab Sabbir. After convincing him, he accepted my proposal to allocate some of CCSE's funding for a Makerspace.

After months of documentation and following World Bank's strict procurement policies, we were able to make a state of the art makerspace with a fully equipped electronics workstation, a small 3D printer, an X-carve and many goodies like lego sets that would allow rapid prototyping. This was my first experience dealing with government grants and it paved the way for writing the grant proposal for Fab Lab IUB.

Due to various reasons which included my detest of acedemic procedures, I ended up leaving work at CCSE afterwords. But it still is one of the finest makerspaces I helped build.

Here are photos of my shenanigans there;
