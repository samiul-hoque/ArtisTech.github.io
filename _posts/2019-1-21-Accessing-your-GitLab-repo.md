# Accessing your GitLab Repo


## Step 1
To access your GitLab repository for the Fab Academy course, you first have to confirm your email for GitLab. Acedemany IT should already have sent you an email to do that.

## Step 2
Once that is done, you'll be granted master access to your GitLab repo and a confirmation email would be sent you.

## Step 3
Now, I am not sure about this step.... kinda..
But I managed a work around :| (sorry, it wasn't intended)
I guess a password was to be sent to you or something for accessing your GitLab Accound.. BUT! if you send a password reset request through git pages, you should be able to rest your password and get in. So that's what I did.

## Step 4
Voila! Now you have access to your GitLab repo!

## Step 5
Click on Academany/Fab Academy/2019/Labs/CEPT/CEPT Students/"_Username_" to go to your repo folder.

You'll then have to add an ssh key pair to sync with git on your local machine to get remote access to your repo. I guess I'll write about that on the next post.
