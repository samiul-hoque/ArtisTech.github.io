# PIC16f628a (mis)Adventures

So I found an ancient PIC16f628a while cleaning my table. I must have bought it at some point and never got to use it for various reasons.

While I was testing it out, I found resources for PIC microcontrollers were kinda hard to get.

And they look really bad. So I ended up making a nice looking pinout diagram. Feel free to use it for your proects :)

And here's the breakout board I ended up soldering myself.
